# Real-time Stock-market prediction
In this repository, I have developed the entire server-side principal architecture for real-time stock market prediction with Machine Learning. I have used Tensorflow.js for constructing ml model architecture, and Kafka for real-time data streaming and pipelining.

## Technologies used:
 1. Kafka.<img align="left" alt="kafka" width="26px" src="./images/kafka2.jpg" />
    - Pipelining logs from source to topics.
    - Topics are subsribed by consumer for real-time ml prediction and model training.
 2. Tensorflow.js.<img align="left" alt="kafka" width="26px" src="./images/tfjslogo.jpg" />
